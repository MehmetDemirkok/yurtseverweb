# JWT Authentication Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing JWT signature verification errors:
```
Error [JsonWebTokenError]: invalid signature
```

This was happening because the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable was not set in the `.env` file, causing the application to use a default fallback value. When JWT tokens were created with one secret and verified with another, the signature verification failed.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added JWT_SECRET to Environment
Added the following line to the `.env` file:
```
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secure_jwt_secret_key_here_2024
```

### 2. Improved Error Handling
Enhanced JWT verification error handling in API routes:

- **User Route** (`src/app/api/user/route.ts`): Added proper JWT error handling with cookie clearing
- **Accommodation Route** (`src/app/api/accommodation/route.ts`): Improved JWT error handling
- **Sales Route** (`src/app/api/sales/route.ts`): Enhanced JWT verification error handling

### 3. Cookie Management
- Created a cookie clearing script (`scripts/clearCookies.js`) for testing
- Improved logout functionality to properly clear invalid tokens

## Impact
- ✅ JWT signature verification errors are resolved
- ✅ Better error messages for authentication failures
- ✅ Automatic cookie clearing for invalid tokens
- ✅ More robust authentication handling

## Next Steps for Users
Since existing JWT tokens were created with a different secret, users will need to:
1. Clear their browser cookies, or
2. Log out and log back in to get new tokens with the correct secret

## Security Note
The JWT_SECRET should be:
- At least 32 characters long
- Random and unpredictable
- Kept secure and not committed to version control
- Different for each environment (development, staging, production)

For production, consider using a more secure secret and rotating it periodically.
